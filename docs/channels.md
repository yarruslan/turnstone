# Channel Integrations

The `turnstone-channel` gateway connects external messaging platforms to
turnstone workstreams via direct HTTP to the server (single-node) or the
console routing proxy (multi-node). Each platform adapter translates
platform-native events (messages, button clicks, slash commands) into
turnstone API calls, and renders workstream output back into the
platform's UI.

Discord, Slack, and Telegram adapters ship today. The adapter protocol is
designed so new platforms can be added with only a new package under
`turnstone/channels/<platform>/`.

---

## Architecture

```
Discord Gateway    Slack (Socket Mode WS)   Telegram (long polling)
       \                  /                    /
        v                v                    v
      turnstone-channel  (one or more adapters)
              |
              v
       turnstone-server   (direct HTTP)
              or
       turnstone-console  (routing proxy, multi-node)
```

A single `turnstone-channel` process can run multiple adapters
simultaneously (e.g. Discord + Slack) — pass the tokens for each
platform you want to enable.

Key components:

- **ChannelAdapter protocol** (`turnstone/channels/_protocol.py`) — generic
  interface for any messaging platform. Defines `start()`, `stop()`,
  `send()`, and `send_notification()`.
- **ChannelRouter** (`turnstone/channels/_routing.py`) — maps
  channel/thread IDs to turnstone workstream IDs. Handles workstream
  creation via HTTP, stale route detection, and user identity resolution.
- **channel_users table** — maps `(channel_type, channel_user_id)` to a
  turnstone `user_id`. Messages from unlinked users are silently dropped.
- **channel_routes table** — persistent channel-to-workstream mappings, including the Discord user
  who started the conversation. The association and owner survive node and bot restarts. Recovery
  runs on the next authorized message.

---

## Discord Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Navigate to the **Bot** tab and click **Reset Token** to generate a
   bot token. Copy it immediately — it is shown only once.
4. On the same **Bot** tab, scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents**
   and enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**
5. Navigate to **OAuth2 > URL Generator**
6. Under **Scopes**, check `bot` and `applications.commands`
7. Under **Bot Permissions**, check:
   - View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Send Messages in Threads
   - Create Public Threads
   - Read Message History
   - Add Reactions
   - Embed Links
8. Copy the generated URL, open it in a browser, and add the bot to your
   Discord server

### 2. Configure Turnstone

**Environment variables** (recommended for Docker):

```bash
TURNSTONE_DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
TURNSTONE_DISCORD_GUILD=123456789  # optional, restrict to one guild
```

**CLI flags** (bare-metal):

```bash
turnstone-channel \
  --discord-token "your-bot-token" \
  --discord-guild 123456789 \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080
```

**Docker Compose** (production profile):

```bash
# In .env file:
TURNSTONE_DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
TURNSTONE_DISCORD_GUILD=123456789
```

Then start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The `channel` gateway runs by default; the Discord adapter activates once
`TURNSTONE_DISCORD_TOKEN` is set.

### 3. Link User Accounts

Discord users must link their account to a turnstone user before they can
interact with the bot. Unlinked users' messages are silently ignored.

1. The user must have a turnstone API token — created via the admin panel
   or `turnstone-admin create-token`
2. In Discord, the user runs `/link`. A modal appears prompting for the
   API token (the token is never visible in Discord audit logs because it
   is submitted via modal, not as a slash command argument).
3. The token is validated against the database. If valid, a
   `channel_users` mapping is created.
4. The user can now @mention the bot or use slash commands.

An admin can also force-link or unlink users via the console admin panel
(Admin > Channels tab).

---

## Slack Setup

Slack uses **Socket Mode**: the bot opens an outbound WebSocket connection to Slack, so no public
URL or API Gateway is required. Install the Slack extra in your Python 3.13 or newer Turnstone
virtual environment (see the [quickstart](../README.md#quickstart)):

```bash
python -m pip install 'turnstone[slack]'
```

### 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click **Create New App**
2. Under **Settings > Socket Mode**, enable Socket Mode. This generates an
   **App-Level Token** (prefix `xapp-`) — copy it.
3. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, add these **Bot Token Scopes**:
   `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, `channels:history`, `im:history`,
   `groups:history`, `mpim:history`, `reactions:write`, `commands`
4. Under **Event Subscriptions** (Socket Mode delivers events), subscribe
   to bot events: `message.channels`, `message.im`, `message.groups`
5. Under **Slash Commands**, create a command (default `/turnstone`)
6. Install the app to your workspace to generate the **Bot User OAuth
   Token** (prefix `xoxb-`).

### 2. Configure Turnstone

**Environment variables** (recommended for Docker):

```bash
TURNSTONE_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-...        # Bot User OAuth Token
TURNSTONE_SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...    # App-Level Token (Socket Mode)
TURNSTONE_SLACK_CHANNELS=             # optional, comma-separated channel IDs
TURNSTONE_SLACK_SLASH_COMMAND=/turnstone
```

**CLI flags** (bare-metal):

```bash
turnstone-channel \
  --slack-token "xoxb-..." \
  --slack-app-token "xapp-..." \
  --slack-slash-command /turnstone \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080
```

The Slack and Discord adapters can be enabled together — pass tokens for
both and the gateway hosts both adapters in one process.

### 3. Usage

- **DM the bot**: messages sent directly to the bot create a workstream
  scoped to that DM; the slash command is not required.
- **Slash command**: `/turnstone <message>` in any channel the bot can
  see starts a per-user channel session.
- Tool approvals render as Slack **Block Kit** buttons; only the user
  who owns the workstream can approve/reject.
- Notifications and reply routing work identically to Discord.
- Session recovery: persisted channel routes are re-subscribed when the
  bot restarts, so existing Slack conversations keep flowing.

---

## Telegram Setup

Telegram uses **long polling** against the Bot API — no public URL is
required. Install with:

```bash
pip install 'turnstone[telegram]'
```

### 1. Create a Bot

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and send
   `/newbot`. Follow the prompts to choose a display name and a username
   (ending in `bot`).
2. Copy the **bot token** it returns (format `<digits>:<secret>`).
3. Optionally enable *privacy mode off* for groups via BotFather so the
   bot can see all group messages, not just mentions.

### 2. Configure Turnstone

```bash
TURNSTONE_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=[REDACTED]        # bot token from BotFather
```

or bare-metal:

```bash
turnstone-channel \
  --telegram-token "123456:ABC..." \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080
```

All three adapters (Discord, Slack, Telegram) can run in one process —
pass the tokens for every platform you want to enable.

### 3. Usage

- **DM the bot**: each private chat is scoped to its own workstream;
  messages route freely.
- **Groups**: the bot only engages when it is mentioned by `@username`
or when a message replies directly to one of its own messages.
- Tool approvals render as Telegram **inline keyboard** buttons (Approve
  / Deny) on the prompt itself.
- Linking: send `/link <your_api_token>` in a DM to map your Telegram
  account to a turnstone user; `/unlink` reverses it. Messages from
  unlinked users are dropped with an inline hint.
- Session recovery and notification replies work identically to the other
  adapters — persisted channel routes re-subscribe on restart, and
  replying to a delivered notification routes back to its origin
  workstream.

---

## Usage

### Conversations

- **@mention** the bot in any allowed channel to start a new conversation.
  The bot creates a Discord thread from the message and a turnstone
  workstream behind it.
- All subsequent messages in the thread are routed to the same workstream.
- The bot streams responses via message edits, updated approximately every
  1.5 seconds.
- If a persisted channel route is no longer active on its owning node, the router asks the create
  endpoint to fork the old workstream into a new ID via `resume_ws`. The saved source can still
  resolve normally; its checkpoint-bounded history, configuration, persona, effective project, and
  attachment references are cloned before the channel route is repointed. The old route remains
  durable until the replacement succeeds. The router swaps the mapping atomically, preserving its
  owner; concurrent recovery cannot overwrite another replacement. Initial messages are sent only
  after the route is claimed. If the create endpoint returns the ordinary source-not-found response
  *and* a fresh authoritative storage lookup confirms that the source is gone, the router retries
  once without `resume_ws` and starts a fresh conversation. Other access, conflict, routing, and
  storage failures remain visible rather than silently discarding history.
- Recovery uses the exact saved workstream ID; another conversation's alias cannot replace it.
  A deleted ID also remains reserved while a channel route references it, preventing a new
  workstream from receiving that channel's messages under the old identity.
- A missing SSE session stops that subscription without deleting the conversation's route. Discord
  thread replies, Slack thread replies, and Slack DMs all check the saved association before sending
  the next message and restore their subscription. With a console, each SSE connection resolves the
  current node address; console errors trigger retries rather than a fallback to the configured node.
- Routes do not expire merely because a node is unavailable. An explicit close removes a route only
  after the node confirms closure (or reports no loaded session), and only if the route still names
  that workstream. A refused close or concurrent replacement retains the association and reports a
  retryable failure.
- Discord recovers uncached threads through the platform API. Missing or inaccessible threads retain
  their saved routes. Only the original linked invoker may send follow-ups or close the workstream;
  approval prompts also identify that invoker, including for bot-owned `/ask` threads.
- Startup recovery subscribes only to already-live workstreams. Direct mode reads the active list
  once; console mode limits both concurrent liveness probes and the total discovery time. Inactive
  and temporarily unreachable conversations keep their associations for lazy recovery on a message.
- `/close` acknowledges privately and archives the thread after confirmed closure.
- Older Discord routes lack a saved invoker. The bot creates these threads, so Discord's platform
  owner cannot identify the human who started them. Start a new conversation with `/ask` in the
  parent channel. Linking an account does not grant ownership of an older thread.

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/link` | Link Discord account to turnstone (opens modal for API token) |
| `/unlink` | Unlink Discord account |
| `/ask <message>` | Create a new thread and workstream with an initial message |
| `/status` | Show workstream info for the current thread (ephemeral) |
| `/close` | Close the workstream, delete the route, and archive the thread |

### Tool Approvals

When manual approval is enabled (the default), tool calls are displayed as
an orange embed with:

- Tool name and argument preview
- **Approve** (green), **Reject** (red), **Always Approve** (gray) buttons
- Only linked users can interact with approval buttons
- The approval decision is forwarded to the server via HTTP

Buttons use static `custom_id` values so they survive bot restarts.
Correlation data (`ws_id`, `correlation_id`) is stored in the embed footer.

**Auto-approval:** When `auto_approve` is true (via `--auto-approve`), or when
all tools in the request match the `auto_approve_tools` list in the adapter
config, the bot auto-responds with approval and posts a
"*Tool auto-approved.*" notice to the thread instead of showing buttons. The
`auto_approve_tools` list is set via the `ChannelConfig.auto_approve_tools`
field (useful for allowing specific tools like `bash` or `read_file` while
still requiring manual approval for others).

## User Identity

- The `channel_users` table maps `(channel_type, channel_user_id)` to a
  turnstone `user_id`
- Self-service linking via the `/link` slash command (modal input, not
  visible in Discord audit logs)
- Admin can force-link or unlink via the console admin panel (Admin >
  Channels tab). Unlinking uses a styled confirmation modal.
- Unlinked users' messages are silently dropped
- A user can be linked across multiple platforms (e.g. Discord + Slack)

See [Security: Database Schema](security.md#database-schema) for the
`channel_users` table definition.

---

## Workstream Lifecycle

1. **Creation** — @mention or `/ask` creates a Discord thread and a
   turnstone workstream. The `ChannelRouter` persists the mapping in the
   `channel_routes` table.
2. **Active** — messages are routed bidirectionally. The bot streams
   responses via message edits (updated every ~1.5 seconds).
3. **Unavailability** — a node restart or capacity eviction can unload a workstream. Its saved source
   and channel association remain durable. An SSE 404 clears only the listener's transient state;
   a connection error reconnects with backoff.
4. **Reactivation** — the next message resolves the saved route and probes
   whether that workstream is live on its owning node. If it is not, the router
   creates a distinct workstream with the old `ws_id` as `resume_ws`. The
   create response confirms the fork and message count; there is no separate
   resume command or channel-specific resumed event. Only after the replacement
   succeeds does the router swap the persisted route. If the source was deleted
   or pruned, an exact source-not-found response plus a second authoritative
   storage miss triggers one fresh-create retry; other fork failures leave the
   old route intact and are surfaced normally.
5. **Close** — `/close` command closes the workstream via HTTP, deletes the
   route, unsubscribes from events, and archives the Discord thread.

## Notifications

> See also: [Notification Flow diagram](diagrams/png/17-notify-flow.png)

The `notify` tool allows the LLM to proactively send notifications to
users or channels on external platforms. This is useful for alerting
people about task completion, errors, or important updates without
waiting for them to check in.

### Targeting

Two modes:

- **Username** — provide a turnstone `username`. The gateway resolves
  it via the `channel_users` table and sends to every linked platform
  the user has (e.g. Discord + Slack).
- **Direct** — provide `channel_type` + `channel_id` to target a
  specific platform channel or user DM.

Discord notifications support user mentions (`<@USER_ID>`), role mentions (`<@&ROLE_ID>`), `@everyone`,
and `@here`. Mention syntax is preserved, and Discord's permissions and each recipient's notification
settings determine whether a ping is delivered. To send a DM, use the user's Discord ID as `channel_id`;
a separate server channel ID is not needed.

### Delivery Flow

Notifications use direct HTTP for low latency. The server calls the channel
gateway directly over HTTP:

1. The LLM calls the `notify` tool with a message and target
2. `_exec_notify()` queries the `services` table for healthy channel
   gateways (heartbeat within the last 120 seconds)
3. The server mints a service JWT (`aud: turnstone-channel`) via
   `ServiceTokenManager` and POSTs to the first healthy gateway. The
   payload includes the originating `ws_id` for reply routing.
4. The gateway validates the JWT, resolves the target, and calls
   `adapter.send_notification()` which sends the message and tracks
   the outgoing message ID for reply routing
5. On failure, the server tries the next gateway. If all fail, it
   retries up to 2 more times (delays: 1s, 3s), re-querying the
   service registry on each attempt

### Bidirectional Replies

Notifications support multi-turn DM conversations. When a user replies
to a notification DM:

1. The bot looks up the originating `ws_id` from the tracked message ID
   (`_notify_ws_map`)
2. Verifies the replying user matches the original notification
   recipient (defence in depth — Discord DMs are already private)
3. Routes the reply to the workstream via `router.send_message()`
4. Registers the DM channel for response forwarding
   (`_notify_reply_channels`)
5. When the workstream responds (`TurnCompleteEvent`), the response is
   forwarded to the DM
6. The response message is itself tracked, so the user can reply again
   for another turn

This enables scenarios like an oncall engineer responding to a CI/CD
failure notification from their phone before opening a laptop.

**Limits:**

- Tracking map capped at 100 entries (FIFO eviction of oldest)
- Entries cleaned up on workstream close/unsubscribe
- Replying to an expired notification sends
  *"This notification is no longer active."*
- DM reply content capped at 4096 characters

### Service Registry

The channel gateway registers itself in the `services` database table
on startup and sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds. On shutdown it
deregisters. Services are considered stale after 120 seconds (4 missed
heartbeats) and are excluded from `list_services()` queries.

The `services` table schema:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `service_type` | Service category (e.g. `"channel"`) |
| `service_id` | Unique instance ID (`channel-<hostname>-<random>`) |
| `url` | HTTP base URL for the service |
| `last_heartbeat` | ISO 8601 timestamp of last heartbeat |
| `created` | ISO 8601 timestamp of initial registration |

### Security

- **Authentication** — the gateway's `POST /v1/api/notify` endpoint requires authentication.
  Configure the server's signing secret with `TURNSTONE_JWT_SECRET` or `[auth].jwt_secret` in
  `config.toml`; the environment variable takes precedence. The gateway reads
  `TURNSTONE_JWT_SECRET`, which must match the server's secret. The server automatically mints JWTs
  with `aud: turnstone-channel`. If the gateway's secret is not set, it fails closed and rejects all
  requests with 401. Server JWTs (`aud: turnstone-server`) are rejected.
- **Rate limit** — maximum 5 notifications per turn. The counter only
  increments on successful delivery, so failures don't consume the
  budget.
- **SSRF protection** — only `http://` and `https://` service URLs are allowed. Other schemes are
  skipped with a warning.
- **Discord mentions** — all bot messages allow user, role, `@everyone`, and `@here` mentions, subject
  to Discord's permissions and the recipient's notification settings.
- **Error redaction** — generic error messages are returned to the
  LLM. Internal details (service IDs, URLs, exception messages) are
  logged server-side only.

### Troubleshooting notifications

Check both the originating server and the channel gateway logs. Each `notify.gateway_failed` event
identifies the gateway, its URL, the attempt, the workstream (`ws_id`), and the tool call (`call_id`).
The event records whether an Authorization header was present, plus the HTTP status, request exception
type, or delivery statuses such as `no_adapter`, `failed`, and `timeout`. Completion notifications log
the same gateway and workstream details under `notify_completion.*`. Gateway URLs omit credentials,
query parameters, and fragments; outbound diagnostics omit tokens, message content, and response
bodies.

A 401 from the gateway occurs before Discord or Slack delivery. `notify.auth_missing` on the server
means it could not find notification credentials. On the gateway, `notify.auth_not_configured` means
its signing secret is missing; `notify.auth_rejected` distinguishes a missing Authorization header,
an invalid scheme or token format, and an invalid JWT. For `invalid_jwt`, check the shared secret, the
`turnstone-channel` audience, token expiry, and host clocks. `notify.auth_insufficient_scope` indicates
a valid JWT without the required `write` scope and returns 403.

With debug logging enabled before credentials are first used, `notify.auth_configured` records the
credential source without its value. A configured `TURNSTONE_CHANNEL_AUTH_TOKEN` overrides automatic
JWT minting and must itself be a valid JWT for the channel audience with `write` scope. Working Discord
or Slack conversations do not verify this outbound notification authentication path.

---

## Adding New Adapters

The `ChannelAdapter` protocol defines the interface any platform adapter
must implement:

```python
class ChannelAdapter(Protocol):
    channel_type: str

    async def start(self) -> None: ...
    async def stop(self) -> None: ...
    async def send(self, channel_id: str, content: str) -> str: ...
    async def send_notification(self, channel_id: str, content: str, ws_id: str) -> str: ...
```

`send_notification()` is like `send()` but associates the outgoing
message with a `ws_id` so that user replies can be routed back to the
originating workstream. Adapters must track the mapping from outgoing
message ID to `(ws_id, target_user_id)` and handle DM replies.

Platform-specific concerns — approval prompts, message edits, thread
creation — live inside the adapter implementation and are not part of
the protocol surface. Each adapter drives those via its
own `_on_ws_event` dispatcher using SDK-native APIs.

To add a new platform:

1. Create `turnstone/channels/<platform>/` package
2. Implement the `ChannelAdapter` protocol
3. Add a `--<platform>-token` flag and detection logic in
   `turnstone/channels/cli.py`
4. Add the optional dependency in `pyproject.toml` (e.g.
   `turnstone[slack]`)

See `turnstone/channels/discord/` as a reference implementation.

---

## Adding a channel to the web console

The backend steps above make the adapter work. To surface the platform in the
console (Admin > Channels), it must also be registered in a few frontend
touchpoints under `turnstone/console/static/`. The value in each is the exact
`channel_type` string the backend emits (e.g. `telegram`).

- `index.html` — the `#cc-type` `<select>` in the `#channel-shelf` dialog
  needs a new `<option>` so the platform is selectable in the link-channel
  form.
- `admin.js` — the `_NOTIFY_CHANNEL_TYPES` array needs a new entry so the
  platform appears in the Schedules "Notify on completion" rows (built by
  `_addNotifyRow()`) and in the link-channel ID-input placeholder.
