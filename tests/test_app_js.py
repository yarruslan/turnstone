    inner/outer-HTML assignment (plain and concat), insertAdjacentHTML,
    legacy doc-write, string-eval, dynamic-Function constructor, and
    string-first-arg timer scheduling.

    Two distinct cleanup postures across the targets:

    1. **Strict DOM-construction** (``ui/static/app.js``,
       ``shared_static/utils.js``, ``shared_static/auth.js``,
       ``shared_static/kb.js``, ``coordinator.js`` chat entry,
       ``console/static/app.js``): renderer output routes through the
       streaming helpers or ``setSafeHtml`` (for pre-baked HTML strings);
       every other site uses ``createElement`` + ``textContent`` +
       ``append`` / ``replaceChildren``.  Missing escapes are
       structurally impossible — no HTML string is ever interpolated.
    2. **Sink-free string-concat** (``console/static/admin.js``,
       ``console/static/governance.js``): operator-facing admin /
       governance pages still build HTML via ``escapeHtml`` + string
       concat, but the unsafe sink is off the call site (everything
       routes through ``setSafeHtml``).  XSS defence still depends on
       every interpolated value going through escapeHtml; the lint
       catches the sink but cannot catch a missing escape.

    All admin-side bundles are now covered.

    The regex covers inner/outer-HTML assignment (plain and
    concat-assignment), ``insertAdjacentHTML``, legacy doc-write, and
    the dynamic-code constructors (string-eval, dynamic-Function,
    string-first-arg timer scheduling).  ``insertAdjacentElement`` is
    intentionally not flagged — it takes a DOM node, not a string.

    Parametrized so each target is its own pytest case — a failure on
    one file is attributed precisely without masking offenders in the
    others.

    Scans the whole file body (not line-by-line) so the regex's

# After the whole-file var → const/let sweep across these 7 bundles, three
# guards keep the post-sweep state honest:
#   1. ``node --check`` per bundle catches parse-level regressions on any
#      future edit (mis-balanced braces, stray tokens) before they reach
#      the browser.
#   2. A var-free static assertion pins the keyword sweep — any future
#      ``var`` declaration in these bundles fails CI loudly.
#   3. A static const-reassign guard catches the specific bug class that
#      shipped through the original sweep (``const X = …; … X = …``
#      throws ``TypeError`` only at call-time, which ``node --check``
#      does not surface).  This is the same paren/string/regex-aware
#      reassignment check the sweep walker uses.
#
# A fourth guard runs ``_redactApiKeys`` via ``node -e`` as a runtime
# smoke; the function is pure (no DOM dependency) so it transplants
# cleanly into a standalone node invocation.


# ``_slice_balanced_body`` is the shared comment-and-string-aware brace
# walker from tests/_js_harness_helpers (imported at the top of this
# file).  Comment awareness is a strict superset of the old string-only

# few pass raw source (the persistence-badge and beforeunload pins),

# comments no longer inflate its depth count.  One implementation means

# PR-D adds a server-side per-ws ring buffer + ``Last-Event-ID`` replay so
# a brief disconnect transparently replays the missed events.  That whole
# foundation is defeated if the browser's ``onerror`` handler explicitly
# closes the EventSource on a transient network error — closing forces a
# CONNECTING -> CLOSED state transition that prevents native auto-reconnect
# from firing.  The post-PR-D contract is: never call ``.close()`` on a
# transient error; let native reconnect run with the ``Last-Event-ID``
# header.  Explicit closes survive only on terminal branches (401 expired
# session, workstream-reassignment to a different ws).  These guards pin
# the contract so a future refactor can't silently regress it.


# ``_strip_js_comments`` is the shared string-aware, offset-preserving
# stripper from tests/_js_harness_helpers (imported at the top of this
# file) — one implementation for every suite, so the string-blind /
# offset-destroying per-suite variants cannot diverge again.

    inside the jitter window); (2) the record is cleared ONLY by a
    successful full render (refetchHistory, below the ``!hist`` guard) —
    never by the teardown chokepoint or suspendStream; (3) the immediate
    branch routes through ``noteTruncatedResync()`` and SKIPS the resync
    when the limiter just tripped (the cooldown disconnected the stream;
    a ``.finally`` reconnect would defeat it), else SCHEDULES the fresh
    connect behind the herd-spreading jitter; (4) churn accounting is ONE
    shared step (``recordChurnAndMaybeTrip``) fed by BOTH overflow closes
    and truncated resyncs, so the trip parameters cannot silently diverge;
    (5) the jitter scheduler dedups to one pending resync and its fire
    path nulls the handle BEFORE loading (the teardown inside the load
    would cancel the work it is part of), while ``closeStreamTransport``
    owns cancellation of a merely-pending timer; (6) the dead-stream flow
    tears down FIRST, resets the streaming refs (refetchHistory does not
    null them, and the envelope's own in_progress_snapshot may have
    re-created a bubble inside the jitter window), seeds via
    ``refetchHistory(true)``, and reconnects in ``.finally`` gated on the
    pane still owning its stream lifecycle (``visHandler`` — the destroy /
    close-session sentinel); (7) every ``truncatedGaps`` bump routes
    through the one increment+log step; (8) the old in-place seedless
    refetch must not come back; (9) repair-intent supersession is ONE
    site — refetchHistory's success path clears the gap record, the
    deferred latch, AND any pending resync timer together (a failed fetch
    returns above the block and clears none, keeping the resync armed as
    repair owner; a latch or timer surviving a heal fired a phantom
    resync whose failed-fetch leg reconnected cursorless with nothing
    armed) — and clear_ui carries no path-local cancel of its own;
    (10) the envelope's sidebar refresh is deduped per GAP
    (isNewTruncationGap) on top of the per-open flag — a failed-resync
    retry loop must not re-stampede /children + /tasks once per reconnect
    — with the retry-window staleness covered instead by ONE heal-time
    refresh on the successful render inside loadHistoryThenReconnect."""

    """``lastEventId`` lives on the MessageEvent — EventSource exposes no
    such property (WHATWG: url/withCredentials/readyState only), so an
    object-form read like ``evtSource.lastEventId`` is undefined in every
    real browser.  All three clients shipped exactly that dead
    conditional: the cursor never tracked live traffic, every MANUAL
    reconnect (close-on-hide show edge, degraded retry, recover beat)
    connected fresh, and turns committed during the gap silently never
    painted — the 2026-07 'turn disappeared' field mechanism.  Only a
    real-browser harness could catch it (source-pattern tests pinned the
    broken form as happily as the fixed one), so this tripwire at least
    pins the corrected form and forbids the dead one by name.

    Guard shape is pinned too — the explicit ``!= null && !== ""`` form.
    On a DOMString this is behaviorally identical to truthiness (the
    valid id "0" is a truthy STRING; only "" and null/undefined are
    falsy here), so the pin is for cross-site symmetry with the NUMERIC
    cursor gates (``_lastEventId != null`` / ``data.cursor != null``),
    where truthiness genuinely drops a valid 0 — one visual idiom for
    every cursor guard keeps a future editor from "simplifying" the
    numeric ones to match a terser string form.

    The GLOBAL stream (app.js) was pinned CURSORLESS here until #881
    landed its boot-epoch signal: global ids are now
    ``"{boot_epoch}-{counter}"``, so a cursor from a prior boot
    mismatches the live epoch and draws ``replay_truncated`` + a fresh
    node_snapshot instead of the old ``replay_ok``-empty ghost-roster
    shape — the reason for cursorlessness is gone, and app.js now
    captures/presents the cursor like the per-ws clients.  Its cursor
    stays an OPAQUE STRING end to end (never ``parseInt``/``Number``
    — the epoch prefix would NaN any numeric read), presented via
    ``?last_event_id=`` (EventSource cannot set the header manually),
    and cleared where the record dies: the ``replay_truncated``
    handler, the ``node_snapshot`` recovery floor (required, not
    belt-and-braces — that id-less frame's MessageEvent inherits the
    connection's stale pre-restart cursor on NATIVE reconnects, so the
    pre-dispatch capture re-stores it and only a branch-level clear
    kills it), and ``onLogout``.  All three clears are pinned below —
    a simplify pass dropping one reintroduces the redundant
    dead-cursor truncated round.

    Comments are stripped before the scan (module-level, string-aware
    stripper) so documentation may name the anti-pattern verbatim — the
